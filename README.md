-- Governance: View and vote on active referenda

-- Fully Client-Side: All blockchain interactions happen directly from your browser

-- Self-Custody: Connect with existing Polkadot wallets like Polkadot.js, Talisman, or SubWallet

-- Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
